# Airline Traveler Classification Project

This project aims to classify airline travelers' satisfaction based on various features such as age, gender, type of travel, class, flight distance, and more.

## Overview

This project involves several stages including:

1. **Initial Dataset Overview**: An initial exploration of the dataset, including checking the structure, dimensions, and basic statistics.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and removing duplicates to prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the relationships between different features and satisfaction levels.
4. **Modeling**: Training a machine learning model, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, to predict traveler satisfaction.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance on both the training and test datasets.

## Initial Dataset Overview

The dataset is explored to understand its structure and contents. This includes examining the first few rows, information about columns, and basic statistics.

## Data Cleaning

Missing values and duplicates are handled to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Various visualizations are created to understand the relationships between different features and satisfaction levels. Key insights include:
- Distribution of satisfaction levels among different demographics.
- Relationship between flight characteristics (e.g., distance, delays) and satisfaction.
- Comparison of satisfaction levels across different classes and types of travel.

## Modeling

A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the dataset to predict traveler satisfaction based on various features.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy scores on both the training and test datasets.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It is available under the title "Airline Passenger Satisfaction" by user Teej Maharsh. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction).
